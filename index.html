			<p>I worked with a team of designers, artists and another programmer to create Half-Baked, a VR Puzzle game where the player must use their arms to move. I was the Gameplay and SFX Programmer, tasked with creating the majority of puzzle elements and game objects such as doors and levers. Half-Baked was created in collaberation with NearLight and got to the interview stage of DARE Academy.</p></div>
